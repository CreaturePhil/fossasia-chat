To start off making this simple chat application, I read the socket.io documentation. After learning the basics of socket.io, I planned out on how I wanted the chat application to be like. Then I would start prototyping it out with the frontend using bootstrap. Furthermore, I lay out the foundation of the chat application with sockets connectivity. Then I added usernames and private messaging.
